# Python Scripts

## Tools

### Python Documentation

Is anyone else a documentation geek like me? Here's [a link to Python's documentation page](https://docs.python.org/3.10/index.html). There's even a great [tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3.10/tutorial/index.html) if you want to jump in and learn!

### Google Colaboratory

I found a tool that I think I'll love!
It's [Google Colabs](https://colab.research.google.com/?utm_source=scs-index). 

[This is the introduction that got me wanting to try it](https://codingandfun.com/how-to-use-python-on-ipad/), and I'm pleased to say at first glance it works great on my iPad Pro!
